  GovReady’s software helps small to mid-size companies sell their software to government by revolutionizing
  preparation of compliance artifacts. Stop struggling with 450 page documents. GovReady guides your team
  step-by-step through FISMA’s NIST Risk Management Framework Authorization and Accreditation (A&A). Learn
  security for your system as our apps generate your policies, plans, and evidence to impress your auditors.

  GovReady enables developers to select “apps” from a compliance store that interact to automatically assemble
  complete A&A packages. Apps represent technical components and organization processes. GovReady’s open
  source Expert System uses the apps to interactively teach security and ask simple questions about your
  software and system. As your team collaboratively answers questions, the Expert System analyzes compliance
  and maintains human and machine-readable versions of your System Security Plan and compliance artifacts.
